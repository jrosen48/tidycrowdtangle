# tidycrowdtangle

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {tidycrowdtangle} is to facilitate accessing [CrowdTangle](URL) data.

This package is a fork of [RCrowdTangle]---it draws extensively on the core functionality of that package.

## Installation

You can install tidycrowdtangle from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jrosen48/tidycrowdtangle)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tidycrowdtangle)

ct_get_links("school", token = "NgdKtOSYfEODUcMjaq8s5p2zzr56kACOgwiJ3prL")
ct_search_posts("school", token = "NgdKtOSYfEODUcMjaq8s5p2zzr56kACOgwiJ3prL")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
